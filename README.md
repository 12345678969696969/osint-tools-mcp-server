## üöÄ Installation

### MCP Server Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/frishtik/osint-tools-mcp-server.git
cd osint-tools-mcp-server
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will automatically install Sherlock, Holehe, Maigret, and TheHarvester.

3. **Configure Claude Desktop:**

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "osint-tools": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/osint-tools-mcp-server/src/osint_tools_mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new MCP server.

### Prerequisites for Additional Tools

Some tools require manual installation due to their complexity:

#### SpiderFoot
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot.git /opt/spiderfoot
cd /opt/spiderfoot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### GHunt
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt.git /opt/ghunt
cd /opt/ghunt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Blackbird
```bash
git clone https://github.com/p1ngul1n0/blackbird.git /opt/blackbird
cd /opt/blackbird
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéÆ Usage Tips

### Getting Started

Working with AI for OSINT is a bit of an art form. Here's how to get the best results:

#### Start Simple with Holehe
I recommend starting with the **Holehe** tool - it's fast, reliable, and gives you immediate results:

```
"Check if john.doe@example.com is registered on any platforms"
```

#### Level Up to Username Searches
Once you're comfortable, try username searches with Sherlock or Maigret:

```
"Search for the username 'johndoe123' across social media platforms"
```

#### Complex Orchestrations
Here's where it gets interesting. You can chain tools together:

```
"I found an email address contact@suspicious-site.com. Can you:
1. Check what platforms it's registered on
2. Extract the domain and search for subdomains and other emails
3. Search for any usernames associated with this domain"
```

#### Let the AI Be Smart
Sometimes the best approach is to give Claude context and let it decide:

```
"I'm investigating the digital footprint of username 'hackerman2024'. 
Use your judgment to gather as much information as possible."
```

### Pro Tips üéØ

1. **Be Patient with SpiderFoot**: It's incredibly thorough but can take up to 30 minutes for a full scan. Start it and grab a coffee!

2. **Parallel Processing**: Claude can run multiple tools simultaneously. Don't hesitate to ask for parallel searches:
   ```
   "Search for 'johndoe' on both Sherlock and Maigret at the same time"
   ```

3. **Know When to Hold the Leash**: 
   - For specific investigations: Be explicit about which tools to use
   - For exploratory research: Let Claude choose the tools
   - For time-sensitive tasks: Avoid SpiderFoot, stick to faster tools

4. **Cross-Reference Results**: Different tools have different databases. Maigret might find accounts that Sherlock misses and vice versa.

5. **Email First, Username Second**: If you have an email, start there - it's usually more unique than usernames.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Usage & Legal Compliance

**üö® IMPORTANT: This tool is for legitimate security research and OSINT investigations only.**

### You MUST:
- ‚úÖ Only gather publicly available information
- ‚úÖ Respect privacy laws in your jurisdiction (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Follow platforms' Terms of Service
- ‚úÖ Use findings responsibly and ethically
- ‚úÖ Obtain proper authorization for any professional investigations

### You MUST NOT:
- ‚ùå Use this for stalking, harassment, or any malicious purpose
- ‚ùå Violate any local, state, or federal laws
- ‚ùå Access private or protected information
- ‚ùå Use findings to harm individuals or organizations

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tools not found**: Make sure all OSINT tools are installed and in your PATH:
```bash
which sherlock holehe maigret theharvester
```

**SpiderFoot errors**: Ensure SpiderFoot is installed in `/opt/spiderfoot` or update the path in the code.

**Timeout issues**: Some tools may timeout on slow connections. Try increasing the timeout parameter:
```
"Search for username with a 30 second timeout"
```

**Rate limiting**: Some platforms rate-limit searches. If you're getting blocked, wait a bit and try again.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This MCP server uses Python's asyncio for non-blocking tool execution. Each tool runs in a subprocess, allowing for parallel execution and proper timeout handling.
